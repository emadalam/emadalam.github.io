                            My professional career dates back to the summer of 2008 during the second year of pursuing my Engineering major in Computer Science. Ever since I have worked for many startups and giant multinationals as full-time employee and as a freelancer too. I have gathered in-depth know-hows of product development especially around web technologies and a thorough understanding for building and scaling engineering and R&D teams within the organization.
                            <br /> <br />
                            Though I use Elixir and JavaScript as my primary weapons of war, being a web architect I have the insights to choose the right tools for the right job. Listed below is a brief highlight of the hard skills that I can bring onboard.</p>
